# LinkedIn Job Search

This is a simple script that uses selenium webdriver to automate the tedious task of job searching and filtering on LinkedIn. It can be adapted to filter for specific keywords in the description of the job opening, as well as the position title itself, and many more.

The presented script searches for "Mechanical Engineer" jobs in a 16km radius from Hengelo, Netherlands, since at the time of creating, for personal reasons, I was looking to relocate to the area. However, since I did not speak any Dutch at the time, it automatically filtered the jobs that had Dutch (Nederlands) as a requirement. If the job matches the requirements, it would save for later manual review and application by me. 

This project is based on the Day 49 of Udemy's course "100 Days of Code" project.

When using this script, please be aware that LinkedIn's layout may be different for you. Since selenium searches for specific tags in the html source code of the page, be sure to check that these match to the script and adapt the code if needed.
