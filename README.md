# Programming Projects Portfolio
Welcome to my Portfolio for all my programming activities.

This is a place where I store all the files, scripts, and other relevant data associated with the programming courses I've taken, as well as personal projects I've coded.

Please feel free to look around! You may use anything you need in your own projects as well.

This is a living repository, so remember to check back often for any new exciting projects!

## Repository Structure and Other Info
Some notes about the folder structures:
- **100-Days-of-Code_Udemy**: This directory holds the exercises and projects for the "100 Days Of Code" course from Udemy, completed in 2024. Days 83 and 85 - 99 are missing because they are not mandatory to the course completion, and some I do not find interesting enough to tackle (e.g. web development exercises), while others I still need to finish.
  
- **Data-Science_Udemy**: This directory holds the jupyter notebooks associated with the Udemy course "Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp", completed in 2024. You can also find [here](https://filipelmf4.github.io/filipe-math-garden/ "Math Garden") a live website of the final project for this course. It employs a simple neural net to recognize the user input to a simple mathematical operation. The garden grows with each correct answer and withers with every wrong answer.
  
- **DrivenData-FluShot**: This directory holds the python script and .csv files for a machine learning competition I took part in, in early 2020, for the DrivenData organisation. The goal was to predict whether a person would get a H1N1 and/or a seasonal flu vaccine based on their backgrounds, opinions and behaviours.
  
- **Other Projects**: This directory is intended to hold all my projects not associated with academic purposes (courses or competitions). For now, I only have the automatic LinkedIn job search and save script. For more info check the ReadMe on the specific directory.
  
- **Python-For-Everybody_Coursera**: This directory holds all the exercises and final project for the "Python 4 Everybody" course from Coursera, offered by the University of Michigan, completed in 2020.


## Projects under development
I have some projects that I am working on or intend to do, namely:
- Stock market analyzer, to more easily analyze data for the stocks I own (and the ones I am eyeing).
- Portuguese kitchen nightmares map (similar to this polish one I found, https://gdziebylamagda.pl) -> Just for fun :D!
- More Kaggle and DrivenData projects!
